## Task: Assessing design tradeoffs

## Overview:
This task involves evaluating design tradeoff related to choosing particular LIDAR sensor types
and battery types for a mobile robot.

## Task objectives

* Analyze the impact of various battery form factors (cylindrical, pouch and prismatic) on system cost, safety and durability.
* Evaluate the performance and cost implications of different LIDAR sensor models for mobile robot.
* Present findings in the form of simple table outlining the cost and performance comparisons for different design phases.
